<h1><a href="{{site.url}}">nuclearpengy</a> - now</h1>

I tend to always be busy. This is a rough summary of what I'm busy with, at the moment.

## Work
I'm currently Product Manager for Sports Media for [Ringier South Africa](https://www.ringier.co.za/). I also run my own business, [MyEcommerce](https://www.myecommerce.codes/), focused on custom software consulting and development.

## Open source
I used to maintain the [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) [WordPress Exporter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ghost/). It was a lot of fun to contribute towards and I learned quite a bit through the process. Sadly, I have not been as active as I would like in the last while.

## Health and fitness
Due to the nature of my work, I spend a lot of time sitting in front of my <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/gear/#workstation">workstation</a>. When I transitioned from working jobs where I was mostly walking around to a mostly sedentary, computer based career, I gained quite a lot of weight and lost a lot of fitness.

I try to eat well and avoid ultra processed foods but I'm not currently winning at time for excercise.

When I do get time, I enjoy walking and going for a ride on my Airdrop Fade Works dirt jump bike.

## Learning
I'm constantly learning; I need to, in order to be able to add value and contribute to my clients' businesses. Much of this learning is driven by the need to solve specific challenges. Outside the scope of task related problem solving, my current focus and interests are Machine Learning and Python. I'm also learning more about OKRs and product management in general.

## Cooking
I cook a lot and it's usually quite a time consuming process. One day, I might open a restaurant but for now I cook for myself and for my family.

At the moment, slow roasted chicken thighs or a cut of lamb are regular features on our menu, two to three different vegetables and sometimes egg fried rice or roast potatoes. If we're pressed for time, spaghetti with a beef ragu is always a winner.

I can also make a pretty mean omelette.

## Coffee
I enjoy coffee, brewing it, drinking it and learning about it. I try to do at least one cupping per month, usually on a Saturday, but sometimes I'll sneak in a cupping before work, if I have enough time.

## Writing
I don't get to do much writing these days besides email, instant messages on Slack and Google Hangouts, and project specification documents.

<!--Besides email and instant messages on Slack and Google Hangouts, my main writing activity is daily journaling which I've been doing consistently since Wednesday, 28 December 2016. Initially attempted as a bit of a [30 Day Challenge](https://www.ted.com/talks/matt_cutts_try_something_new_for_30_days) but eventually ended up turning into my alternative to posting random things on social media that most people don't care about reading anyway. -->

I need to get back into daily journalling, at some point.

I am quite interested in writing a book about my experience running my own business but haven't become fully inspired yet and I would like to get back into blogging; I should probably start by editing and publishing my drafts. <!-- but for now, journaling consistently is where it is at. -->
