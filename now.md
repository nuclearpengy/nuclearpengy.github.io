<h1><a href="{{site.url}}">nuclearpengy</a> - now</h1>

I tend to always be busy. This is a rough summary of what I'm busy with at the moment.

## Work
I'm currently the WordPress platform lead for [Ringier South Africa](https://www.ringier.co.za/), plugin developer for [PayFlex](https://www.payflex.co.za/), maintaining plugins for WooCommerce, PrestaShop, OpenCart and Magento, and a technology consultant for [BackaBuddy](https://www.backabuddy.co.za/).

## Open source
I maintain the [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) [WordPress Exporter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ghost/). It's been a fun project to contribute towards and I've learned quite a bit through the process.

## Health and fitness
Due to the nature of my work, I spend a lot of time sitting in front of my <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/gear/#workstation">workstation</a>. When I transitioned from working jobs where I was mostly walking around to a mostly sedentary, computer based career, I gained quite a lot of weight. This is made especially worse when combined with my love for good food.

Since September 2019, Amelia and I have been making an effort to eat differently, drink a lot of green tea with ginger and lemon, and try to go for walks when we remember. I've lost a good few KGs and my clothes are feeling a lot more comfortable so I'm hoping the habits stick and we can maintain a healthier lifestyle for years to come.

## Learning
I'm constantly learning; I need to, in order to be able to add value and contribute to my clients' businesses. Much of this learning is driven by the need to solve specific challenges. Outside the scope of task related problem solving, my current focus and interests are Machine Learning and Python.

## Cooking
I cook a lot, often multiple times per day and sometimes for hours at a time. One day, I might open a restaurant but for now I cook for myself and for my family.

One of my current favourites is omelettes with red onion, button mushrooms, green pepper, garlic and cream cheese, seasoned with black pepper and salt.

## Writing
Besides email and instant messages on Slack, Skype and Google Hangouts, my main writing activity is daily journaling which I've been doing consistently since Wednesday, 28 December 2016. Initially attempted as a bit of a [30 Day Challenge](https://www.ted.com/talks/matt_cutts_try_something_new_for_30_days) but eventually ended up turning into my alternative to posting random things on social media that most people don't care about reading anyway.

I am quite interested in writing a book about my experience running my own business but haven't become fully inspired yet and I would like to get back into blogging at some point but for now, journaling consistently is where it is at.
