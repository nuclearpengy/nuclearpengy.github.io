<h1><a href="{{site.url}}">nuclearpengy</a> - now</h1>

I tend to always be busy. This is a rough summary of what I'm busy with at the moment.

## Work
I'm currently Product Manager for Jobs Marketplaces for [Ringier South Africa](https://www.ringier.co.za/). I also run my own business, MyEcommerce, focused on custom software consulting and development.

## Open source
I used to maintain the [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) [WordPress Exporter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ghost/). It was a lot of fun to contribute towards and I learned quite a bit through the process. Sadly, I have not been as active as I would like in the last while.

## Health and fitness
Due to the nature of my work, I spend a lot of time sitting in front of my <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/gear/#workstation">workstation</a>. When I transitioned from working jobs where I was mostly walking around to a mostly sedentary, computer based career, I gained quite a lot of weight. This is made especially worse when combined with my love for good food.

Since September 2019, Amelia and I have been making an effort to eat differently (better). I lost a bunch of weight, then gained it back again, and now I'm busy getting in shape again. If the weather is good and I get to finish work in time, I go for a ride on my Airdrop Fade Works dirt jump bike.

## Learning
I'm constantly learning; I need to, in order to be able to add value and contribute to my clients' businesses. Much of this learning is driven by the need to solve specific challenges. Outside the scope of task related problem solving, my current focus and interests are Machine Learning and Python. I'm also learning more about OKRs and product management in general.

I'm also busy learning to manual; it's much more difficult than I thought it would be.

## Cooking
I cook a lot, sometimes for hours at a time. One day, I might open a restaurant but for now I cook for myself and for my family.

At the moment, stir fry is a regular feature on our menu, with red, green and yellow pepper, button mushrooms, garlic and bok choy, seasoned with sesame oil, soya sauce, black pepper and salt, with slow roasted chicken thighs or maybe seared wagyu beef steak.

I'm also putting our nutribullet to good use making smoothies with apples, oats, honey, chia, sunflower and pumpkin seeds, with almond milk.

## Writing
I don't get to do much writing these days besides email, instant messages on Slack and Google Hangouts, and project specification documents.

<!--Besides email and instant messages on Slack and Google Hangouts, my main writing activity is daily journaling which I've been doing consistently since Wednesday, 28 December 2016. Initially attempted as a bit of a [30 Day Challenge](https://www.ted.com/talks/matt_cutts_try_something_new_for_30_days) but eventually ended up turning into my alternative to posting random things on social media that most people don't care about reading anyway. -->

I need to get back into daily journalling at some point.

I am quite interested in writing a book about my experience running my own business but haven't become fully inspired yet and I would like to get back into blogging at some point. <!-- but for now, journaling consistently is where it is at. -->
