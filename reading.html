<p>I read a lot. I used to spend a lot of time reading Tweets and social media updates but now I spend more time reading blog posts, articles and books. If you're interested in what books I'm reading, you can follow along on <a href="https://goodreads.com/nuclearpengy">Goodreads</a> and if you'd like to know what articles I'm reading, you can follow me on <a href="https://getpocket.com/@nuclearpengy">Pocket</a> or subscribe to the blogs I'm following on <a href="https://feedly.com/nuclearpengy">Feedly</a> or simply check out the list below.</p>

<h2>Blogs</h2>
<p>Here's a list of blogs I follow; in the old days, this would have been called a blogroll. There are quite a few more I should add to the list so consider this very much a WIP.</p>

<h2>Books</h2>
<p>I enjoy reading books but only digital ones; I vehemently dislike paper. My ebook reader of choice is the Kindle app on my iPhone; I use the black reading theme and Bookerly font. I'm strongly considering getting a Kindle. I didn't enjoy reading when I was younger but now I do so I'm trying to read more books these days. Here's a list of what I've read so far and what I'm busy reading.</p>
