<h1><a href="{{site.url}}">nuclearpengy</a> - reading</h1>
<p>I read a lot. I used to spend a lot of time reading Tweets and social media updates but now I spend more time reading blog posts, articles and books (when I'm not reading and replying to Slack messages).<br/>
If you're interested in what books I'm reading, you can follow along on <a href="https://goodreads.com/nuclearpengy">Goodreads</a> and if you'd like to know what articles I'm reading, you used to be able to follow me on Pocket but then Mozilla killed Pocket. You can find some of the feeds I subscribe to on <a href="https://feedly.com/nuclearpengy">Feedly</a> or simply check out the list below.</p>

<h2>Blogs</h2>
<p>Here's a list of blogs I follow; in the old days, this would have been called a blogroll. There are quite a few more I should add to the list so consider this very much a WIP.</p>
<a href="http://pauljacobson.me/">Paul Jacobson</a><br/>
<a href="https://seths.blog/">Seth Godin</a><br/>
<a href="https://www.elezea.com/">Rian Van Der Merwe</a><br/>

<h2>Books</h2>
<p>I enjoy reading books but only digital ones; I see huge value in physical books but haven't gotten into reading them myself. My ebook reader of choice is currently the Kindle app on my iPhone; I use the black reading theme and Bookerly font. I'm strongly considering getting a Kindle. For some bizarre reason, I didn't enjoy reading when I was younger but now I do so I'm trying to read more books these days. Here's a list of what I've read so far and what I'm busy reading.</p>
