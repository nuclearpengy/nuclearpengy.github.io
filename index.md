<p>Hi, I'm Nathan Jeffery, founder and CEO of <a href="https://myecommerce.codes" target="_blank">MyEcommerce</a> and director and CPO of <a href="https://hlalani.co.za" target="_blank">Hlalani IQ</a>.</p>
<p>I'm a results driven, technology strategist and business enthusiast.</p>
<p>I have a broad range of work experience including <a href="https://nathanjeffery.co/2014/10/12/ten-years-on-the-web/" target="_blank">10 years in technology and digital</a>, 10 years in hospitality and entertainment, 2 years in retail and 2 years in private adult education.</p>
<p>I enjoy streamlining non-tech businesses using technology and I've had the privilege to work on systems in FinTech, EdTech and GovTech.</p>
<p>I <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/writing/">blog</a> at <a href="https://nathanjeffery.co">nathanjeffery.co</a> and sometimes publish content on <a href="https://blackplunger.com/author/nathan">blackplunger.com</a> but spend a lot more time <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/reading/">reading</a> than I do writing.</p>
<p>I'm irrationally optimistic.</p>
