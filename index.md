<h1>nuclearpengy</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Nathan Jeffery (aka nuclearpengy - short for nuclear penguin). This is my home, if you can have such a thing, on the web.</p>
<p>I'm a results driven, technology strategist, full stack software debugger, and machine learning and business enthusiast. This may sound glamorous, to some, but in reality, I spend most of my day in conference calls, reading and replying to instant messages and email, and doing research or fixing bugs in software.</p>
<p>I have a broad range of <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/working/">work experience</a> including more than <a href="https://nathanjeffery.co/2014/10/12/ten-years-on-the-web/">10 years in technology and digital</a> (almost 20), 10 years in hospitality and entertainment, 2 years in retail and 2 years in private adult education.</p>
<p>I enjoy streamlining non-tech businesses using technology and I've had the privilege to work on systems in FinTech, EdTech, GovTech and Marketplaces.</p>
<p>I <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/writing/">blog</a> at <a href="https://nathanjeffery.co">nathanjeffery.co</a> and sometimes publish content on <a href="https://blackplunger.com/author/nathan">blackplunger.com</a> but spend a lot more time <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/reading/">reading</a> than I do writing.</p>
<p>I'm irrationally optimistic.</p>
<p>The easiest way to reach me is on <a href="https://twitter.com/nuclearpengy">Twitter</a>; feel free to DM me. You can also find me at numerous other places <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/links/">online</a>.</p>
<p>I'm generally quite busy but I enjoy a good cup of specialty coffee, a glass of wine or a whisky so if you're ever in George, let me know and maybe we can meet up.</p>
